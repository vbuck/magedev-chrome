# Magento Developer Tools
## Environment Tagging

How many times have you changed something on production but thought you were working
from your dev environment? If you said "never," you lied.

This Chrome browser extension provides page tagging for Magento developers, so that 
whatever tab you have open to a page, its tab icon and page content will be specially
marked according to its environment type:

* Development
* Staging
* Production

Currently these three environments are supported. Submit an issue for additional
support or a PR if you can add it yourself!
